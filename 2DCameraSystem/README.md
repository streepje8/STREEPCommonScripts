# 2D Camera System
A 2D Camera system that has a camera follow a target via a track

## How to use
Put both scripts in your project.
Right click in your assets folder to create a new camera track.
Add the camera dolly script to your camera and drag in your target (or set it via a script).
Drag in your track.
Pick your mode.
Then click on the camera track in your assets folder and set the points the camera can be at.


## Problems with the code
The system allows the camera to move freely from every dot to every dot, the green lines can be misleading since the camera is not exactly forced to follow them.
Tracks can be hard to set up for non technical people.
The free camera sometimes is a bit trippy around corners.
